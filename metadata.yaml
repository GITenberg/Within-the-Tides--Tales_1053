description: This collection of four Joseph Conrad tales was first published in 1916
  and includes The Panther of Malta, The Partner, The Inn of the Two Witches and Because
  of the Dollars. Having English as an acquired language did not deter Conrad from
  becoming one of the greatest prose stylists in English literature. A master at creating
  atmosphere, he portrayed individuals suffering from isolation and moral disintergration,
  and particularly the clash between primitive cultures and modern civilization.
